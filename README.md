# Rehan Siddiqi 🍅🤖🦾
Robotics + Embedded Systems | ROS 2, C++, Python | University of Guelph

I build autonomous robot systems that connect perception, planning, and real-world hardware. I work on greenhouse harvesting robotics at the University of Guelph’s Robotics Institute, and rover firmware/software with the Guelph Robotics Team.

## Now
- Autonomous manipulation in clutter (RGB-D perception + motion planning)
- RL for robot arms in Isaac Sim (Isaac Lab, PPO, parallelized training)
- Embedded robotics firmware (STM32, CAN, real-time comms, reliability)

## Highlights
- OMPL planning with real-time RGB-D obstacle detection for autonomous greenhouse harvesting
- ROS 2 perception with Detectron2 and YOLO for real-time fruit detection
- FANUC teleoperation and debugging tooling for distributed ROS 2 systems
- Low-latency embedded comms: UDP pipelines, STM32 UDP-to-CAN control
- Stereo depth benchmarking: S2M2 vs Intel RealSense, plus latency + 3D centroid accuracy analysis

## Tech stack
- Robotics: ROS 2, MoveIt2, OMPL, Gazebo, MuJoCo, Isaac Sim
- Perception: OpenCV, Detectron2, YOLO, RGB-D workflows, PyTorch
- Embedded: STM32, FreeRTOS, micro-ROS, CAN, UART, SPI, I2C, UDP/TCP
- Tools: Docker, Linux, Git, CMake, FastAPI, SQLite
