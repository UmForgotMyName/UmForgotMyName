  <b>About Me:</b> I’m a computer engineering student who builds robots and the software behind them. I work across perception, motion planning, and embedded systems. Recently I have been building harvesting robot pipelines, developing firmware and control for mobile robots, and using simulation to test and validate ideas before running on hardware.
